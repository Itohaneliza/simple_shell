This is a command line interpreter, or shell, in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson in 1971. This was made as a project for Holberton School. In this project we apply the knowledge that we have learned in C programming language. Standard functions and system calls employed in simple_shell include:

access, execve, exit, fork, free, malloc, read, signal, wait, write.
